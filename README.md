## What is this document?

This is the general README file for DBGEN and QGEN, _**the data-base population and executable query text generation programs used in the TPC-H benchmark.**_ It covers the proper use of DBGEN and QGEN. For information on porting the utility to your particular platform see Porting.Notes.

## What is DBGEN?

_**DBGEN is a database population program for use with the TPC-H benchmark.**_ It is written in ANSI 'C' for portability, and has been successfully ported to over a dozen different systems. While the TPC-H specification allow an implementor to use any utility to populate the benchmark database, the resultant population must exactly match the output of DBGEN. The source code has been provided to make the process of building a compliant database population as simple as possible.
